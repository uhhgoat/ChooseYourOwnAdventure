			You just look down at the man as he fumbles through his small book. 
			He begins to speak in a language you do not understand. 
			You begin to feel odd. He completes a few more stanzas. 
			Your skin begins to burn. He keeps reading. 
			Your entire body at this point writhes in pain. 
			He completes the last of the stanzas and you realize why 
			there was no mother waiting for you to hatch.
